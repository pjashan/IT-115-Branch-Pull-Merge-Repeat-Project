Like Hell You Are
By Isabel Duarte Gray

The Devil made a meal of me and all
the Sundays I was sleeping.
To think of all the hours,
what I might've offered to the Book or of the Book
to needful ears grown up like burdock in our hag-rid
thorn-bit flock of town.

Sunday at the bedpost, heeling way
a good dog might, his face near a man's.
He kept a blade to pick his teeth, what fathers used
for supper fixed the way our mothers did,
hog meat from a creature slaughtered on the land.
